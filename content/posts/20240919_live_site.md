## WELCOME!
Hello, and welcome to my first official site post! Thank you for taking the time to review this content. I had never in the past created a full website, but I was motivated to do so to learn more about building and deploying code. My first project was to build a [this] blog site which runs on Apache2 web server from an EC2 Ubuntu instance. The site itself was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Static Site Generator. Future plans include adding CI/CD functionality to ingest new content, build the new site, and deploy to the host environment.

## EC2/SSH/Git Configuration
In order to build and deploy my site, I required a server to run all my services and store my files. I chose an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance for this exercise to learn how to better work with Linux. This also made sense so I could learn what it takes to launch a full website.

Once my EC2 instance was up and running and I had functional SSH access, it was time to SSH onto my machine and begin the work. First step was to install Apache2 on my EC2 instance and verify it was functional:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2
systemctl status apache2
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # Gets public IP address
```
I used the curl command to find my public IP address so I can verify outside connectivity to my server.

After validating functionality, my next step was to download Hugo, install Hugo in a location accessible to my PATH, and delete the extra files:
```bash
cd /usr/bin/
sudo wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.134.2/hugo_extended_0.134.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf hugo_extended_0.134.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz -C hugoFiles
sudo mv hugoFiles/hugo hugo
sudo rm -fr hugoFiles
sudo rm -f hugo_extended_0.134.2_linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
You can validate the install by using running
```
hugo version
hugo v0.134.2-1c74abd26070b0c12849550c974a9f3f1e7afb06+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-09-10T10:46:33Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

Lastly, I required Git on my system to track changes so I set and validated basic configurations:
```bash
sudo apt install git
git config --system user.name "MyGitHubUsername"
git config --system user.email "MyEmail@domain.com"
git config --system init.defaultBranch main
git config --list --show-origin # Verify all settings
```
I decided to set the configuration for all users (`--system`) instead of my user (`--global`) since I am the only person accessing my system.

## Hugo Site/Repo Configuration 
The next step in getting my site to go live was to create the necessary files. For this, I used my HOME directory to create my Hugo project files and complete the initial configuration using the Ananke theme. This allowed me to run the command to build and preview my bare-bone web site locally using the URL indicated by the Hugo process:
``` bash
cd ~
hugo new site quickStart
cd quickStart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo theme = 'ananke' >> hugo.toml
hugo server
```
I also configured the `.gitignore` file at this point to ignore some of the build files(`public/1, 1.hugo_build.lock`, and `resources/`). Other changes to make at this point included giving the site a title via the `hugo.toml` file:
```groovy
baseURL = 'https://example.org/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'Aaron Flores'
theme = 'ananke'
```

At this point, I had a baseline website/git repo. Since I wanted to enable source control, I created an empty repo in my [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/aaronflores92) to hold my changes. I hadn't yet authenticated or configured SSH access for git, so I did that as well.
First step was to create a SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "MyEmail@domain.com"
# Some prompts appear at this point, but I accepted the defaults and created a key without a passphrase
# Key is created
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Next, I added the SSH public key to my GitHub account and tested my SSH connection:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy all returned contents so you can easily add to GitHub via paste
# Move to GitHub, click my profile photo, and select Settings
# Click on SSH and GPG keys under the Access section to the left
# Click the New SSH key button, give my key a name, paste the contents I copied, and click the Add SSH key button to save my key
ssh -T git@github.com
# Confirm you want to continue connecting when the prompts appear; you should see asuccess message display after with your username
```
Lastly, I set the final configurations on my local repo to commit and push my changes via ssh:
```bash
cd ~/path/to/hugo/quickStart
git remote add origin git@github.com:myUser/MySite.git
git remote -v # Validate the remote repo I will be pushing to
git add . # Stage all my files, minus those in the .gitignore file
git commit -m "add: baseline site commit" # Commit a baseline copy of my site
git push origin main # Publish my changes to GitHub
git branch -u origin/main # Sets the existing branch to track the remote branch on GitHub
```

Voila! I now have my site, to which I added my first post:
```bash
hugo new content content/posts/my-first-post.md
# Make additions to my markdown file to be translated to static HTML pages
git add .
git commit -m "add: first post w/ custom content"
git push
```

## Apache2 Web Server Configuration
Again, the choice for Apache2 was to easily configure a web server while at the same time learn how to configure and manage one. Since I already followed the steps in the EC2/SSH/Git Configuration section, I know my Apache2 web server is installed and valid. I can now set my configuration to access my site from the web.
I started by disabling the server's default page:
```
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
systemctl reload apache2
```

Next, I configured the firewall to follow security best-practices. To see which applications can be configured by Ubuntu's firewall, run
```bash
sudo ufw app list
# Output:
# Available applications:
#   Apache
#   Apache Full
#   Apache Secure
#   OpenSSH
```
I allowed `Apache Full` and `OpenSSH`. It was necessary to include OpenSSH or else when the firewall is enabled, I would lose my SSH connection and SSH access and would be unable to re-connect without lots of work or worse:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw status
# Output:
#  Status: disabled
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
# Output
#  Status: active
#
#  To                         Action      From
#  --                         ------      ----
#  Apache Full                ALLOW       Anywhere                  
#  OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
#  Apache Full (v6)           ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
#  OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)  
```

After enablign the firewally, I began the work so Apache can serve my site:
```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo mkdir MyDomainName
cd MyDomainName
sudo mkdir public_html # Will hold our static site pages
sudo mkdir log # Will hold log files
sudo mkdir backups # Will hold backups
```
Next, I moved to the web server configurations to create a new configuration for my site:
```bash
cd /etc/apache2/sites/available
sudo vim MyDomainName.conf
```
And added and saved the following configuaration:
```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
  # Admin email, Server Name (domain name), and any aliases
  ServerAdmin MyEmail@domain.com
  ServerName MyDomainName
  ServerAlias www.MyDomainName

  # Index file and Document Root (where the public files are located)
  DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html/MyDomainName/public_html

  LogLevel warn
  ErrorLog /var/www/html/MyDomainName/log/error.log
  CustomLog /var/www/html/MyDomainName/log/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
Once saved, I enabled my website and validated by going to my public IP address:
```bash
sudo a2ensite MyDomainName.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

At this point, only the contents of my public_html directory were being returned (empty). To complete my work and publish my site, I compiled my hugo project (with this post) and copied the site contents to my site's `public_html` folder:
```bash
cd ~/path/to/hugo/quickStart
hugo server -D # Recompiles all files, including any drafts
# I hit ctrl+C to stop my local site instance
cd /var/www/html/MyDomainName
sudo cp -a ~/path/to/hugo/quickStart/. /var/www/html/MyDomainName/public_html
```

That is all! I now have a functional site (using an IP address) with a single posting. Thank you for reading through this, it was a fun learning experience for me.
